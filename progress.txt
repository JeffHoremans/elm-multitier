Version 1
------------
- Multi-tier commands wrap server and client commands which are unwrapped by the program methods for server and client.
- Configuration for server, including hostname, port and the ability to host the client file
- Basic remote procedure support
- Remote procedures are only registered when defined at compile time
  --> need for sending arguments at runtime
- No server state yet

Version 2
----------
- Redesign of procedures
- Every module now needs to define its own Procedure type and a mapping function that maps those procedure types to remote procedure.
  Procedures of submodules are mapped and batched together so that the program uses one single mapping function and procedure type.
  A remote procedure is a type containing all what is needed for a client or server to handle server commands.
  To perform a server command only requires a procedure, which contains all argument data. Both client and server use the mapping
  function to get the data they require for the specific procedure. The client needs handlers for success and error scenarios when
  it wraps the command to a server request, and the server needs the actual task to execute. The mapping function handles applying the
  arguments contained in the given procedure to get that task.
- An encoder and a decoder is required for the procedure type and this has to be done with care so that every procedure is encoded and
  decoded correctly and uniquely. Sub-procedures need to be mapped in the same regard.
